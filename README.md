# Docker Setup Script Documentation

## Overview

The Docker Setup Script is a powerful automation tool designed to streamline the process of setting up Docker containers with various Linux distributions and populating them with source code from GitHub repositories. Its primary goal is to simplify and expedite the workflow for developers and system administrators, ensuring quick and easy setups with minimal manual intervention.

## Purpose

The utility of this application lies in its ability to create a consistent and reproducible environment, perfect for development, testing, or deployment scenarios. By automating the setup process, users can eliminate the repetitive tasks involved in container creation, package installation, and repository cloning. This not only saves time but also reduces the risk of human error, ensuring a more efficient and reliable setup process.

## System Requirements

- A Unix/Linux-based system
- Docker installed and running
- Internet connection (for pulling Docker images and cloning GitHub repositories)
- Git installed on the host machine

## Installation

1. Download the script `create_docker_container.sh` from the provided source.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the downloaded script.
3. Give execute permissions to the script:

   ```bash
   chmod +x create_docker_container.sh
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the script:

   ```bash
   ./create_docker_container.sh
   ```

2. Follow the on-screen prompts to select the desired Linux distribution for your Docker container:

   - `1) Ubuntu`
   - `2) Kali Linux`
   - `3) Debian`
   - `4) Exit`

3. If you choose `Ubuntu`, `Kali Linux`, or `Debian`, you will be prompted to:

   - Enter a name for your Docker container.
   - Enter the GitHub repository URLs (comma-separated) that you wish to clone into the container.

4. The script will then proceed to create the Docker container, install Git, and clone the specified repositories into the container.

5. Upon successful completion, a confirmation message will be displayed, and you can start using the Docker container with the cloned repositories.

## Error Handling

The script includes error handling to manage common issues that might arise during the setup process. If any error occurs (e.g., Docker not installed, failure to pull Docker image, etc.), the script will display a relevant error message and exit, ensuring that the user is aware of the issue and can take appropriate action.

## Conclusion

The Docker Setup Script is a valuable tool for developers and system administrators seeking a quick and reliable method to set up Docker containers with specific Linux distributions and source code repositories. By automating the repetitive and error-prone aspects of the setup process, it enhances efficiency, consistency, and reliability, contributing to a smoother and more productive workflow.
